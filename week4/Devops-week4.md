# 1: What are the key drivers for moving to the cloud?

There are several key drivers for organizations to move to the cloud, including:

Cost savings: Cloud computing offers cost savings by reducing the need for on-premises hardware, software licenses, and IT personnel.

Scalability: Cloud computing allows organizations to quickly and easily scale up or down their IT resources to meet changing business needs.

Agility: Cloud computing enables organizations to rapidly develop, test, and deploy new applications and services, reducing time-to-market and increasing competitiveness.

Accessibility: Cloud computing allows employees to access applications and data from anywhere with an internet connection, making remote work more feasible.

Disaster recovery: Cloud computing offers more robust disaster recovery capabilities than traditional on-premises solutions, as data is replicated across multiple data centres in different geographic locations.

Security: Cloud providers offer advanced security features and protocols, which can often exceed those of on-premises solutions.

# 2: Types of Storage on cloud.

There are several types of storage in cloud computing, including:

Object storage: Object storage is a type of cloud storage that allows users to store and access unstructured data, such as images, videos, and documents, in a scalable and cost-effective manner. 

Block storage: Block storage is a technology that controls data storage and storage devices. It takes any data, like a file or database entry, and divides it into blocks of equal sizes. The block storage system then stores the data block on underlying physical storage in a manner that is optimized for fast access and retrieval. Developers prefer block storage for applications that require efficient, fast, and reliable data access. Think of block storage as a more direct pipeline to the data. By contrast, file storage has an extra layer consisting of a file system (NFS, SMB) to process before accessing the data.

File storage: File storage is a type of cloud storage that allows users to store and access files in a central location, making it ideal for applications that require shared access to files. File storage supports common file protocols such as NFS and SMB, making it compatible with a wide range of applications.

Archive storage: Archive storage is a type of cloud storage that is designed for long-term storage of data that is rarely accessed but needs to be retained for compliance or business reasons. Archive storage is typically less expensive than other types of cloud storage, but retrieval times may be slower.

Hybrid storage: Hybrid storage is a type of cloud storage that combines on-premises storage with cloud storage, allowing users to take advantage of the benefits of both. Hybrid storage is useful for organizations that have a mix of legacy applications and modern cloud-native applications.

# 3: What are cloud-native applications?

Cloud-native applications refer to software applications that are designed and optimized to run in a cloud computing environment. These applications are built using cloud computing principles and are designed to take advantage of the flexibility, scalability, and reliability of cloud infrastructure.

Cloud-native applications are typically developed using containerization, microservices architecture, and DevOps methodologies.

# 4: What is cloud monitoring?

Cloud monitoring is the process of monitoring and managing cloud-based resources and applications to ensure that they are functioning optimally and securely. Cloud monitoring typically involves using monitoring tools and services provided by cloud providers or third-party vendors. These tools and services can help monitor various aspects of cloud infrastructure and applications, such as CPU usage, memory usage, network traffic, storage capacity, and application logs.

# 5:What is multi-cloud, hybrid multi-cloud, and serverless?

Multi-cloud refers to the practice of using multiple cloud computing services from different providers, rather than relying on a single provider for all cloud-based services. Hybrid multi-cloud is a combination of on-premises infrastructure, private cloud, and public cloud services from multiple providers. In a hybrid multi-cloud environment, applications and workloads can be deployed across different environments based on their specific needs. Serverless is a cloud computing model where the cloud provider manages the infrastructure and automatically allocates and provisions resources as needed to execute and scale applications. In serverless computing, developers focus solely on writing code for the application logic, while the cloud provider takes care of everything else, including infrastructure management, automatic scaling, and other operational tasks.

# 6: What is Cloud Infrastructure (Regions, Computing Resources, and Storage)?

Cloud infrastructure refers to the collection of hardware and software elements required for cloud computing, including computing resources, networking, storage, and virtualization resources. Cloud infrastructure is typically provided by cloud computing providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. Cloud infrastructure regions refer to the geographic locations where the cloud provider has data centres and can provide cloud services. These regions are interconnected by high-speed networks and allow users to choose the region closest to their customers or data centres to minimize latency.

# 7: Cloud Security and threats.

The common threats are zero-day exploits, advanced persistent threats (APT), Cyberattacks, Internal threats and Insufficient identity, credentials, access, and key management.

# 8: What is the difference between DevOps and DevSecOps?

DevOps and DevSecOps are two different approaches to software development and deployment, with DevSecOps aiming to integrate security practices into DevOps pipelines. One of the most significant operational differences between DevOps and DevSecOps is the timing of security practices. DevOps typically handles security at the end of the development process, while DevSecOps applies security practices throughout the process from start to finish.
